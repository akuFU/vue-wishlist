The show was created, executive produced, written and starred comics/writers Bob Odenkirk and David Cross. The show also starred Tom Kenny, Jill Talley and John Ennis. Featured performers/writers included Paul F. Tompkins, Jerry Minor, B.J. Porter, Scott Aukerman, Brian Posehn, and Jay Johnston. Featured performers included Mary-Lynn Rajskub, Brett Paesal, and Sarah Silverman. The show has spawned a movie based on popular character Ronnie Dobbs in Run Ronnie Run.
